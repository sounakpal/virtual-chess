  Bogged down by the Coronavirus, the entire country is in a lockdown for 21
  days. This gave rise to the idea of a Virtual Chess Tournament . It will be a
  roundrobin format tournament, played completely virtually among 10 thugs from
  different cities. The very cool app from Chess.com will be used by the
  players.
